# SomeContract Overview

This document provides details about `SomeContract`, a smart contract developed for the Move Virtual Machine (VM) using the Move programming language. The contract includes a struct named `SomeStruct`, which encompasses several variables and functions, and a resource titled `SomeResource`, each with its specific characteristics and functionalities.

## `SomeStruct` Details

### Variables Description

- `a` (String): Variable that can be set publicly.
- `b` (String): Variable that is accessible to the public.
- `c` (String): Variable that can only be accessed within the contract.
- `d` (String): Variable restricted to access by itself.

### Functionality

- `publicFunc()`: A function that is available for public use.
- `contractFunc()`: A function that is restricted to the contract's scope.
- `privateFunc()`: A function that is privately restricted within its scope.
- `structFunc()`: A function located within the struct, identified as "AREA 1".

### Initialization Process

The initialization of the struct occurs within the `init()` function of the contract, where all variables are set to their default values.

## `SomeResource` Overview

This section of the contract introduces a resource named `SomeResource`, which contains:

- A publicly accessible variable `e` (Int).
- A function `resourceFunc()`, highlighted as "AREA 2".

The resource is initialized with a default value in its respective `init()` function.

## Public Functions Available

- `createSomeResource()`: Function to create and return a `SomeResource` instance.
- `questsAreFun()`: A publicly available function, denoted as "AREA 3".

## Main Module Introduction

The principal module incorporates the `SomeContract` through importation from address `0x05` and includes a `main()` function, marked as "AREA 4".

## Usage Instructions

To utilize `SomeContract`, follow these steps:

1. Deploy `SomeContract` onto the Move VM.
2. Utilize the contract's functions as needed:
   - Invoke `createSomeResource()` to generate a `SomeResource` instance.
   - Use `questsAreFun()` to engage in enjoyable quests.
   - Explore additional functionalities based on requirements.

## Dependency Information

The contract requires the `SomeContract` module, available at address `0x05`.
